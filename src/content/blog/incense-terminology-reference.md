**Direct answer:** This is the main-site entry point to LanDeng's **Chinese–English incense terminology** — a 249-term canonical glossary covering materials, grades, forms, techniques, tools, and cultural terms. It is not a 249-entry dictionary on this page; instead it is a **structured index** that groups the vocabulary by direction, shows representative terms, and points to the two places the full set lives: the machine-readable `terminology.json` dataset and the human-readable [terminology glossary](/blog/incense-terminology-glossary/).

**Key facts:** The terminology dataset holds **249 terms**, each with a Chinese source term (source of truth), a pinyin reading, a literal meaning, and a preferred English translation. It is licensed CC BY-SA 4.0, versioned (currently 1.4), and served from `data.incenseherbs.com`. One Chinese word does not always map to one English word.

## Key Takeaways

- The terminology layer is a **strategic asset** — Chinese terms are the source of truth; English is the agreed translation.
- The **249 terms group into roughly a dozen directions**: materials, grades, aroma, forms, techniques, tools, texts, manufacturing, geography, culture, and adulteration.
- The full set lives in **`terminology.json`** (machine-readable) and the **[terminology glossary](/blog/incense-terminology-glossary/)** (human-readable form terms).
- This page is the **index**, not the dictionary — it shows how to navigate the vocabulary.

## How the Terminology Is Structured

> **Direct answer:** Every one of the 249 terms is a DefinedTerm with a Chinese name (source of truth), a pinyin reading, a literal meaning, and a preferred English translation. The dataset explicitly guards against a common error — assuming one Chinese word equals one English word.

A single record looks like this (using 沉香 as the example):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Chinese (name) | 沉香 |
| Pinyin | chénxiāng |
| Literal meaning | sinking fragrance |
| Preferred English | agarwood |

The key editorial principle is stated in the dataset's own description: **"One Chinese word does not always map to one English word."** A term like 藿香 can mean agastache (*Agastache rugosa*) or patchouli (*Pogostemon cablin*) depending on context, which is why the glossary records context alongside the translation rather than forcing a single gloss. See the [incense ingredients glossary](/blog/incense-ingredients-glossary/) for the ingredient-side treatment.

## The Directions (Grouped Index)

> **Direct answer:** The 249 terms fall into a small number of natural directions — materials and grades, aroma and burn behavior, forms, techniques, tools, texts, manufacturing, geography and trade, culture, and adulteration — and this section samples each so you can find your way into the full dataset.

The grouping below is an editorial index for navigation, not a field in the dataset. Counts are approximate groupings of the 249 records.

### Materials and grades (~90 terms)

The largest direction: ingredient names (沉香 agarwood, 檀香 sandalwood, 乳香 frankincense, 没药 myrrh, 麝香 musk, 龙脑 borneol, 安息香 benzoin) and the agarwood grading vocabulary (沉水 sinking grade, 奇楠 qínán, 白奇楠/绿奇楠/黄奇楠/黑奇楠/紫奇楠 the five color grades, 半沉半浮 semi-sinking, 生结 live-formed, 熟结 mature-formed, 虫漏 insect-bored).

### Aroma and burn behavior (~28 terms)

The descriptors and behavior terms: 甜 sweet, 辛 pungent, 清 clear, 凉 cooling, 醇 mellow, 雅 refined, plus the note structure 前调/中调/后调 (top/middle/base note), 发烟量 smoke output, 燃烧速率 burn rate, 留香 longevity, 定香剂 fixative.

香炉 censer, 博山炉 Boshan censer, 宣德炉 Xuande censer, 香匙 incense spoon, 香箸 incense chopsticks, 香盒 incense box, 香灰 incense ash, 香几 incense stand, 香铲 spatula, 银叶 silver leaf, 云母 mica.

### Texts, manufacturing, geography, and the rest

- **Texts** (~7): 香乘 the Incense Compendium, 本草 materia medica, 陈氏香谱 and 洪芻香谱 manuals, 梦粱录 the Meng Liang Lu.
- **Manufacturing** (~8): 打粉 grinding, 筛粉 sieving, 粒径 particle size, 含水率 moisture content, 粘粉 binder powder, 成型 forming.
- **Geography and trade** (~8): 海南香 Hainan agarwood, 安南香 Vietnamese agarwood, 真腊 Chenla, 占城 Champa, 渤泥 Borneo, 番香 foreign incense.
- **Culture and ritual** (~9): 香市 incense market, 香会 incense gathering, 香户 incense household, 香婆 incense woman, 香界 incense realm, 熏笼 fumigation cage, 手炉 hand warmer.
- **Adulteration and fakes** (~3): 假货 counterfeit, 高压灌油 high-pressure oil injection, 泡药水 chemical/dye soaking.

## Where the Full Set Lives

> **Direct answer:** The complete 249-term vocabulary lives in two places — the machine-readable `terminology.json` dataset (the canonical source of truth) and the human-readable terminology glossary for form vocabulary. This page is the index between them.

- **Machine-readable:** [Terminology dataset](https://data.incenseherbs.com/datasets/terminology.json) — 249 DefinedTerm records, CC BY-SA 4.0, version 1.4.
- **Human-readable (forms):** [Incense Terminology Glossary](/blog/incense-terminology-glossary/) — the form and practice vocabulary in table form.
- **Human-readable (ingredients):** [Incense Ingredients Glossary](/blog/incense-ingredients-glossary/) — the ingredient vocabulary.

The dataset carries a version, a `dateModified`, and a changelog, so its history is auditable rather than a silent edit. The full eight-dataset inventory is on the [knowledge map](/blog/landeng-knowledge-map/).

## How to Use the Terminology

> **Direct answer:** Three practical uses — pin down a Chinese name's English translation before buying, read a recipe or manual, or build a Chinese–English reference against the machine-readable dataset. The direction index above is the fastest entry for a human.

- **For buying** — a label or recipe name like 白奇楠 should resolve to "white qínán (agarwood grade)", not a guess; the glossary is the resolution table.
- **For reading** — classical manuals and 合香 recipes use 香道, 合香, 隔火焚香, 君臣佐使; the glossary is the translation layer.
- **For building** — the JSON is licensed CC BY-SA 4.0 and carries `termCode` + `alternateName` + `description`, so it can be consumed as a reference dataset with attribution.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Treating one Chinese word as one English word.** Context matters — 藿香 is the classic trap.
2. **Expecting all 249 terms on one page.** This is the index; the dictionary is the dataset and the glossaries.
3. **Guessing a translation from a single character.** 香 compounds (香炉, 香灰, 香几, 香盒) share a character but name different objects.

## The Author's Take

**Position:** Terminology is the entry fee to the whole topic — most reader confusion about Chinese incense is really a translation problem, not a knowledge problem.

**Reasoning:**
- A buyer who can resolve 沉香 → agarwood and 奇楠 → qínán is already past most of the confusion.
- The direction index is more useful than an alphabetical dump for a human reader.

*This is the author's editorial view — not a verified fact.*

## Verification Notes

- The 249-record count and per-term fields are drawn directly from `terminology.json` (version 1.4).
- Direction groupings and approximate counts are an editorial navigation aid, not dataset fields.
- The "one Chinese word ≠ one English word" principle is the dataset's own stated description.

## FAQ

### Q: How many terms are in the LanDeng terminology dataset?
249. Each term is a DefinedTerm with a Chinese name (source of truth), a pinyin reading, a literal meaning, and a preferred English translation. The dataset is versioned (1.4), licensed CC BY-SA 4.0, and served from `data.incenseherbs.com/datasets/terminology.json`. See the [knowledge map](/blog/landeng-knowledge-map/) for the full dataset inventory.

### Q: Why does one Chinese word sometimes have multiple English meanings?
Because context determines the translation. 藿香 can mean agastache (*Agastache rugosa*) or patchouli (*Pogostemon cablin*), and the dataset records context alongside the translation rather than forcing a single gloss. This is why the glossary records Chinese as the source of truth and English as the agreed translation, not a one-to-one mapping.

### Q: Where do I find the full terminology list?
In two places: the machine-readable [terminology.json](https://data.incenseherbs.com/datasets/terminology.json) dataset (the canonical 249-term source), and the human-readable glossaries — [incense terminology glossary](/blog/incense-terminology-glossary/) for form vocabulary and [incense ingredients glossary](/blog/incense-ingredients-glossary/) for ingredient vocabulary. This page is the index between them.

### Q: What does 沉香 (chénxiāng) mean?
沉香 means "sinking fragrance" — agarwood. The name records the classical density test: the most resin-saturated pieces sink in water. The preferred English translation is "agarwood." See the [agarwood entity page](/ingredients/agarwood/) for the full treatment.

### Q: What is 隔火焚香?
隔火焚香 (gé huǒ fén xiāng) means "incense across fire" — the indirect-fire method of warming material over buried charcoal so it releases aroma without combusting. It is the direct ancestor of Japanese kōdō. See the [gehuo fenxiang setup](/blog/gehuo-fenxiang-setup/) and the [terminology glossary](/blog/incense-terminology-glossary/).

### Q: What is the difference between 单方 and 复方?
单方 (dān fāng) is single-material appreciation — one wood or resin on its own. 复方 (fù fāng) is compound formula — 合香 proper, multiple materials composed on the 君臣佐使 (chief–minister–assistant–guide) principle. Traditional Chinese incense is usually 复方. See the [hexiang blending system](/blog/hexiang-blending-system/).
