## Routing & storage

- Forms route to a first-party inbox (email) — **no public DB** in Phase 1.
- Storage/backends are provisioned in Phase 3. Do not hardcode email recipients in client-side code.

## First-party data loop

Every inquiry captures: query · landing page · topic · product/ingredient/material interest · wholesale/OEM intent · customer question · unmet information need.

Feed back into: demand intelligence → content → research → product → commercial. See DEMAND-MODEL.md.

## Security & spam

- CSRF + basic anti-spam (honeypot) at minimum.
- No secrets exposed client-side.
- Confirm double-opt-in where email marketing is ever added (not in Phase 1).
